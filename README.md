 technical test submission

1) What is wrong with the component you chose?
 
It's busy, there's a lot going on in the small box. 
There are a lot of options and text in the boxes and it looks a bit cluttered. 
In some boxes there are multiple links that go to the same page. 
It's not obvious where the links are. It isn't clear the box headers are buttons. Some things that seem clickable aren't.

2) How will you improve it?

I will remove unnecessary and duplicate links. 
I will remove superfluous text. 
I'll make the whole box clickable.

3) Given more time what would you further improve?

I would like to improve the section heading. 
I could maybe add different buttons like the original had for the different types of individual insurances such as veteran horse and rider buttons.
I felt like the colours could be improved on the cards but I thought it was best if I stick to the colour scheme on the website.
There is a minor bug on one browser when I tested so I would fix that given more time.
Maybe add a box shadow and other small style changes.
