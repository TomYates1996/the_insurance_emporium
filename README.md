 technical test submission

1) What is wrong with the component you chose?
It's busy, there's a lot going on in the small box. There are too many options in the box and it looks messy. In some boxes there are multiple links that go to the same page. The text is maybe a little small.

2) How will you improve it?
I will remove unnecessary and duplicate links. 

3) Given more time what would you further improve?
I need to see what I can do in the 3 hours first and then see what I've got left that could be improved.
